This will be a part journal part portfolio part blog kind of thing for me. i understand an intro is in order im basically an electrical electronics major i like ai ml and hardware programing so most of my git would have projects related to either one or both of them
i was advised to start this as both a portfolio and also as a way to keep myself motivated to complete my projects and stuff.

Skill set: (primarily just c and python )
Languages i know : high level: c 
                               c++
                               python
                               embbedded c
                   graphing/more research related languages: r (wpouldnt say im skilled just yet mainly use to understand concepts related to machine learning and visualise them)
                   low level languages: verilog
                                        assembly
